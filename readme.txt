This is the KNN algorithm which uses euclidean distance to choose attributes. The model was trained with and tested on the same satellite, yeast and pendigits data as the binary decision tree.

Programming language used: Java

Instructions:

-Open terminal, use 'cd' command to change to the directory containing the files, or drag that folder following the cd command in terminal, press enter

-To compile, type "javac classify.java"
-to execute, type "java dtree argument1 argument2 argument3 k"
where argument1 and argument2 are names of training and test data text files respectively.
Argument 3 is classifier 'knn' and k is the number of neighbours to consider.
